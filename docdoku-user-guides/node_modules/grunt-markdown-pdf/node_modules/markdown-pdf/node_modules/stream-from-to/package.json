The callback function `cb` will be invoked when data has finished being written.\n\n### to.buffer(opts, cb)\n\nCreate a [concat-stream](https://npmjs.org/package/concat-stream) and pipe output from the through stream to it. The callback function `cb` will be invoked when the buffer has been created.\n\n### to.string(opts, cb)\n\nCreate a [concat-stream](https://npmjs.org/package/concat-stream) and pipe output from the through stream to it. The callback function `cb` will be invoked when the string has been created.",
